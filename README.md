# drewcleaver.com

This repository contains the scaffolding for **drewcleaver.com** built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Newsletter Signup

The homepage includes a newsletter signup form that sends subscribers to Klaviyo.
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
KLAVIYO_LIST_ID=your_list_id
```

Restart the development server after adding environment variables.

## SEO Component

The `SEO` component in `components/SEO.js` centralizes all meta tags for each
page. It provides sensible defaults for title, description, keywords and the
Open Graph image so the site is optimized when shared on LinkedIn, Instagram and
GitHub. Pass custom values per page or rely on the builtâ€‘in fallbacks.
